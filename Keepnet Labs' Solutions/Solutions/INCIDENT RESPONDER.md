# Incident Responder

Even with the best technologies in place, it’s important to prepare for malware that slips through your traditional security systems and reaches your inbox.

Our [Phishing Simulator](https://www.keepnetlabs.com/anti-phishing-solutions/phishing-simulator/) and [Awareness Educator](https://www.keepnetlabs.com/anti-phishing-solutions/awareness-educator/) modules minimize your employees’ susceptibility, and our [Email Threat Simulator](http://github.com) module proactively reduces the volume of inbox events.

Our Incident Responder module is designed to catch the rest!

[The Incident Responder module](https://www.keepnetlabs.com/resources/incident-responder/) allows users to report suspicious emails with one click, sending an email’s content to us for header, body and attachment analysis.

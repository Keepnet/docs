Phishing has become a huge threat to businesses and consumers worldwide, and the number of recorded phishing attacks continues to grow exponentially. It’s predicted that by 2020 phishing will be the number 1 cyber-threat to your organisation.

Due to the nature of phishing, your colleagues and employees have become the weak link in your cybersecurity.

Our industry-leading [Phishing simulation](https://www.keepnetlabs.com/phishing-simulator/) module allows you to test and quantify that human vulnerability safely and proactively by sending benign phishing attacks to your team, tracking their actions and reporting back to you.

We don’t stop there, our Phishing Simulation module is fully-integrated with our [Awareness Educator](https://www.keepnetlabs.com/anti-phishing-solutions/awareness-educator/) to automatically place employees who are caught by our phishing simulations onto appropriate e-learning courses to improve their vigilance to genuine phishing attacks.

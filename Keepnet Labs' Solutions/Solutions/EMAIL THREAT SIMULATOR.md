# Email Threat Simulator

By learning new generation phishing attacks, [email threat simulator](https://www.keepnetlabs.com/resources/e-mail-threat-simulator/) can test new generation APT products (Fireeye, Deep Security, etc.) and the anomaly detection systems (SIEM) along with traditional protection mechanisms (Antispam, Antivirus, Content Filter, etc.) and configure the protection options you observe.

95% of all cyber attacks on enterprise networks are the result of successful spear phishing.

At Keepnet Labs, we have taken a holistic approach to this problem by creating complimentary product modules that focus on [People](https://www.keepnetlabs.com/phishing-simulator/), [Process](https://www.keepnetlabs.com/phishing-simulator/) and Technology.

Our Email Threat Simulator module regularly tests your technological investments (such as firewalls, anti-spam and anti-virus), using simulation logic to mimic the attack vectors targeting organisations through your email services.

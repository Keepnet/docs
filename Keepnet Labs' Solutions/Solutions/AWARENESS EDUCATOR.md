# Awareness Educator

Quantifying your organisation’s vulnerability to phishing attacks and cyber threats, in general, means nothing if you don’t have a process in place to make improvements through education.

At Keepnet, we understand this and have developed cutting-edge training which can be targeted and on-demand via our [Awareness Educator](https://www.keepnetlabs.com/awareness-educator/) module.

The Awareness Educator is tightly integrated with our [Phishing Simulator module](https://www.keepnetlabs.com/phishing-simulator/) to automatically funnel users who are caught by our phishing simulations into appropriate and engaging e-learning courses, ensuring they become more aware of threats and better-equipped to identify sophisticated phishing emails in the future.

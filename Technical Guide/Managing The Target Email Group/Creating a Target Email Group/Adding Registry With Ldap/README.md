# Adding Registry With Ldap

If you made Active Directory integration, with “Add User LDAP” option, users might be transferred to the system.

You can define the Active Directory, as well as integration under “Advanced Settings > Ldap Settings” heading. Under this heading, you can find how the definitions are. 

With “Query in Db” option, you might search a name, department or thes options. If you leave it blank and clicked on it, the name and details of all registered users will be seen on the screen. Then, with “Import All”  option, all users or with “Import Selected” option, only the chosen users can be imported into the system

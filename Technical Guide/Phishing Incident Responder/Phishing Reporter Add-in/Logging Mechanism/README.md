# Logging Mechanism

Keepnet Add-in logs all problems and reports both of userâ€™s computer (C:\Users\Public\KeepnetLabs\Log) and keepnet server.

In order to resolve the problem please check logs.

***Outlook add-in log directory***

* Older Logs: Add-in compresses and archives older logs in .zip format bigger than 8MB
* Installer: Add-in keeps the logs that appeared during the installation.
* Keepnet Outlook Add-in Log: The log file that keeps the logs created when add-in functions.

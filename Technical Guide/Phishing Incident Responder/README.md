## About Keepnet Phishing Incident Responder

Keepnet phishing incident responder module analyses² a suspicious email and according to results, it takes action at the inbox level.

In addition to the analysis engines it owns, Keepnet also analyses with the engines of different technologies it is integrated. In this way, it enables an institution to acquire the technologies that it doesn’t have.

## Differentiations

The traditional methods of investigating and deleting of a suspicious email have many limitations:

1. Making an investigation in email server like the exchange, postfix etc. causes
	1. serious performance consumption,
	2. finding a needle in a haystack with a single source,
	3. the need for the coordination of different teams which delays to detect the incident and response it.  **With the survey we conducted, we observed that the average period of making an investigation in the enterprise sector was one day.³**

2. Due to synchronisation problem, a copy of an email that you deleted from the email server may still be in the user’s email inbox which will not protect your user from risks. Especially for mobile users working outside the office network, it is a severe problem for organisations to find and delete a malicious email from the inboxes.

3. However, since Keepnet does this operation through the add-in technology that each user has in their email, it can complete the incident investigation and response process under a minute without any performance problems.⁴ 



1. A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw in the software, hardware or firmware that is unknown to the party or parties responsible for patching or otherwise fixing the flaw. Find out more at [https://bit.ly/2kKZbfn](https://bit.ly/2kKZbfn)

2. **What does trigger an incident investigation?:** When a user discovers a suspicious email, by using outlook phishing reporter plugin, he/she reports it to Keepnet with a single click. Or by using Keepnet incident responder, a SOC team member can initiate a manual investigation and take action for the suspicious email. Also, analyses can be made according to Indicators of compromise with feedbacks from various sites. See [“How does an investigation mechanism work?“](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13aMqkHzMDianiMyAyxKBgAL0q14qvHzNLIBGFm8xsjA/edit#heading=h.ohx7vcp56yn6)  heading for more details.

3. We have surveyed in the enterprise sector using Keepnet Labs cybersecurity awareness platform to reveal an average period for making an incident investigation. According to the findings, the average period of making an incident investigation was one day. This result indicated that the organisations using traditional methods to discover and analyse a suspicious email are vulnerable to the new generation attacks because they have lost a lot of time.

4. We got these statistics from the experience of 30 enterprises using Keepnet Incident incident responder.

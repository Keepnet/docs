# LDAP Settings

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an Internet protocol that email and other programs use to look up information from a server.  By providing integration of Windows Active Directory and LDAP, it is possible to import user accounts to the system. You can access on  “Advanced Settings > Ldap Settings” page.

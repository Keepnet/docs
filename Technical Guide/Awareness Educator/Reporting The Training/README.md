# Reporting the training

With detailed reporting option, you can get a statistical detail of the users’ training.  These statistics allow measuring the efficiency.

* The user who gets the training email
* The user who clickings on training link
* The user who completes the training 
* The user who shows no action

There is an opportunity to report, make a comparison between the users or departments, or if exists, for sub-company.

The education progress, as well as users’ completion rates, are clearly included in the reports.

You can access the training report from the Report Manager section. [We’ve shown you how to open the report manager section earlier](https://www.keepnetlabs.com/documentation/#report-manager).

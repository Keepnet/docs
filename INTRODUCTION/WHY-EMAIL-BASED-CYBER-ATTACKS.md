# Keepnet Labs focuses on cyber threats coming from email
Four out of five organisations (80%) have faced an email-based cyber attack in 2017. Email is a critical threat vector, which allows malicious third parties to directly target employees within an organisation.

Today companies are using tools like many border security components such as AntiSpam, Firewall, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS / IPS) as well as Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) systems. Moreover, sometimes they take additional measures like a zero-day protection product, reputation analysis service, cyber intelligence support. Well, how much do these systems protect systems from email-based cybersecurity attack vectors?

Also, despite the availability of tools and technologies such as email encryption, data loss prevention, social engineering detection, phishing simulation and artificial intelligence which can help mitigate email-based cyber threats, the risks are subsisting.

Therefore, Keepnet Labs provides a holistic approach which embraces people, processes and technology elements for a complete solution.
